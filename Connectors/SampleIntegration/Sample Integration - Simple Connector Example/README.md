# Sample Integration - Simple Connector Example
This is an example of a simple connector. It's integrated with "api.vatcomply.com" service and provides all of the main design ideas necessary to build a stable connector. Dynamic List defines what rates should be returned for a given currency and expects input in the format "EUR" etc.
